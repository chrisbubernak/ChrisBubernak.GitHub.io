Software Engineer by day, [professional ultimate player](http://seattle.rainmakers.mlultimate.com/player/chris-bubernak/) by night. I enjoy solving problems and drinking copious amounts of coffee in the morning.

I'm an avid reader of software engineering blogs and have decided to take the plunge into putting my own thoughts to paper. We'll see how it goes.
