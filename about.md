I'm a 24 year old from Colorado currently living in Seattle. Software Engineer by day, [professional ultimate player](http://seattle.rainmakers.mlultimate.com/player/chris-bubernak/) by night. I enjoy anything active, solving problems with computers and drinking copious amounts of coffee in the morning.

I've always been an avid reader of tech blogs and finally decided start putting my own thoughts to paper. We'll see how it goes.
