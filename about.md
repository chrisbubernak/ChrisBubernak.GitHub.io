I'm a 24 year old from Colorado currently living in Seattle. Software Engineer at Microsoft by day, [(former) professional ultimate player](http://seattle.rainmakers.mlultimate.com/player/chris-bubernak/) by night. I enjoy anything active, building things, and drinking copious amounts of coffee in the morning.
