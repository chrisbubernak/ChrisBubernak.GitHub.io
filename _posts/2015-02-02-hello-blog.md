I finally decided to pull the trigger and take the plunge into the world of blogging. I'd been thinking about this for awhile but kept struggling with the idea of what kind of unique perspective I can bring to the table. I'm not well known for anything in particular and I have no deep expertise in any domain. What is it that makes people actually care about what I have to say?

What ultimately ended up serving as the tipping point was the idea that my blog should be a platform for keeping track of my own thoughts and ideas and if anything beneficial to others can come out of it, well than thats really just icing on the cake.

With that being, said it's really tough to tell at this point what kind of direction I'll be taking. I have a short backlog of topics I'd like to tackle but after that... your guess is as good as mine for what comes next.

That's all I really have for now but to prevent this from being totally devoid of anything moderately related to "real content" I suppose its worth mentioning the pieces powering this blog. I did a little reading up on blogging solutions and ended up deciding on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) + [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (hipster programmers everywhere just all collectively rolled their eyes in unison) approach. 

Static sites seem to be all the rage these days and so I put aside my (totally unfounded by surprisingly hard to shake) disdain of Ruby and got Jekyll set up on my machine. This ended up being a more painful experience for a Ruby Noob (a Roob?), like myself, than I care to admit. 

I originally wanted to do everything from scratch but in the end I wound up just forking this theme from [John Otander](http://johnotander.com/). I highly recommend anyone getting started with a blog to do the same. Focus on the content and punt on the details (at least for the time being). 

Anyways, thats all I have for now. Hopefully the next time you find your way back to this blog I'll have something more interesting to say.
