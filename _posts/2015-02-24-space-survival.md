I have a few side projects I've been working on for a while now and it's getting to the point where I'm thoroughly convinced I will be working on them till the literal end of time. For someone like me, that is hyper OCD about leaving things unfinished, constantly thinking about all of these loose ends is akin to Chinese water torture.

Every time I commit some code, I invariably find myself creating a laundry list of new things that __NEED__ to be done. New features to add, pesky bugs I have to track down, and refactoring that one really ugly function prefixed with the comment, "HACK: Abandon all hope ye who enter here". Very much a  "one step forward, two steps back" situation.

Anyways, to get my mind off the thought of an eternal bleak existence of continually getting further from ever actually completing anything, I decided to do something seemingly totally counterproductive and start yet _another_ project. 

I had seen the self imposed ["build a new game every week"](http://www.lessmilk.com/12games) challenge that Thomas Palef put himself through awhile back and was really impressed with the games that he had produced and wanted to do something similar. I wanted it to be entertaining, but more so than anything else, it had to be something that I could call "done" and walk away from in a relatively short amount of time.

I began coding on the bus to work one day, in what was really more of just a "stream of conscious" coding session than anything else. I spent some more time on the bus home and ideas and direction started to emerge out of my aimless typing. Before I knew it what began as the block moving around shooting things that you see above eventually turned into a (mostly) fully fledged spaceship survival game.

I've added a few hours of work to polish it a bit since then, but for the most part it really all came together that first day and I have to say, it feels great. I highly recommend to anyone who ever finds themselves in a similar situation to just set aside your normal project(s) for a few hours/days, work on something totally different and then step back from your keyboard and marvel at how awesome you are! 

Anyways, you can play the game [here](/space/) and check out the source code on [github](https://github.com/chrisbubernak/ChrisBubernak.GitHub.io/tree/master/demos/space). Fair warning: the game is pretty challenging, if you can beat my current high score of 29 I'll be impressed!
